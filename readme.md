Things that i need to look into:

- consider [qtile](https://github.com/Darkkal44/Cozytile/blob/main/.config/qtile/config.py)
  - Further things to look at: [Youtube video with a great repo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpPwicjTKU)
  - Nice config: [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1akyjoh/qtile_ive_finally_found_what_i_was_looking_for/)
- Bash instead of zsh, git can be handled by [git-prompt-string](https://old.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1c95jer/gitpromptstringlualinenvim_add_gitpromptstring_to/)
- Using Chrome to open up Outlook and teams (This depend if its easier to manage)
